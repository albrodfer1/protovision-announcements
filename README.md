# protovision-announcements

## April 26, 2025

Protovision is proud to announce that Project Riptide, previously under active development, is now officially available to the public.

Today marks a significant milestone for our company: not only is Project Riptide ready for everyone to experience, but all documents, materials, and resources related to the project have been fully declassified and made publicly accessible. There is no longer any confidential information associated with Project Riptide — everything we have created for it is now open for the community, industry professionals, and players around the world to explore.

This release reflects Protovision’s commitment to transparency, innovation, and fostering a deeper connection with our audience. We believe that by making every part of Project Riptide’s development process available, we empower players and creators alike to better understand, enjoy, and even build upon what we’ve made.

All details about Project Riptide — including technical documentation, creative assets, developer notes, and more — can be accessed directly through our official website.

We are incredibly excited to finally share this project in its entirety with you. Thank you for being part of our journey.

— The Protovision Team
